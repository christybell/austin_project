## Presentation

<ins><b>Predictive Wine Ratings</ins></b><br>
For this repository we have created a machine learning model that can predict the rating of wine based on various inputs such as price, origin, and variety. This topic was selected because it offers descriptive features that the model can learn from and was also just interesting to us as a team. This data set was posted on Kaggle and compiled by Wine Magazine. We hope to be able to plug variables into the model and have it output a predicted rating of a given wine.<br><br>

## Machine Learning Model

#### <ins><b>Question we'd like to answer with our machine learning model</ins></b><br> ####
Can we accurately predict a wine's rating based on several factors such as price, grape variety, and region of origin?<br><br>
#### <ins>**Machine Learning Model**</ins><br> ####
We chose a random forest model since we need a supervised learning model. Random forest algorithms are great to use for classification or regression problems and typically produce a higher degree of accuracy. The model does a good job to avoid overfitting and it can efficiently handle large datasets like ours.<br><br>
<ins>**Output Label**</ins><br>
Our machine learning model's output label is a wine rating -- a continuous value between 80 and 100 -- otherwise known as "points" in the dataset.<br><br> 
<ins>**Model's Accuracy**</ins><br>
Let's face it -- no one will die if they drink a glass of wine that is rated inaccurately. If our model predicts some vintages to rate below their actual rating, it will be unfortunate. The consumer may notice and be unhappy. However, it's possible that the consumer will not notice and drink the wine anyway.<br><br> 
<ins>**How does our model work?**</ins><br>
Please see MLModel_flowchart.png for a flowchart of the process for our machine learning model.<br><br>
