# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean and prepare our data for analysis. All members of the group are familiar with Pandas so this came as an easy decision and should allow the analysis to run smoothly.

## Database Storage
PostgresSQL will be used for database storage. We will also be using a Flask template to display the data. Again, this decision was made due to familiarity.

## Machine Learning
For the machine learning portion, we have chosen to use a SciKitLearn Random Forest model. This was chosen due to a high degree of accuracy, the reduced chance of overfitting using this model as well as the need to use a supervised model.

## Dashboard
For our dashboard, we plan on using Python 3 along with a Flask template which will then be hosted on Google Cloud Console.
